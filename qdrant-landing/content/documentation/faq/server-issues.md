## Server Connection Issues

### What if I have a timeout during a batch upsert?

The easiest fix would be to set max_retries to a higher value and set the timeout higher as well when you instantiate QdrantClient. However, we also recommend keeping the entire batch size (including vector & payload) under 5MB.

### I have too many vectors and I canâ€™t upload them all to RAM.

Directly writing to disk is a lot faster when doing a huge upload batch.You want to use memmap support. During collection creation, memmap may be enabled on a per-vector basis using the on_disk parameter. This will store vector data directly on disk. Read more about [configuring mmap storage](../../concepts/storage/#configuring-memmap-storage).

### The server stopped responding via HTTP. 

If you indexed a large number of points and there is not response, try debugging. If no information is available in debug, please contact support on Discord with all the necessary information to reproduce the issue.

### Qdrant Docker fails to start repeatedly on Ubuntu 20.04 

We are currently finding there are permissions issues with Docker.
